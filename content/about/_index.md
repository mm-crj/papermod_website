 newHi, there! I am currently a PhD student at  the [Institute of Scientific Computing](https://tu-dresden.de/mn/math/wir/das-institut?set_language=en), [TU Dresden](https://te-dresden.de) and I work with [**Jun. Prof.Markus Schmidtschen**](https://markusschmidtschen.com). 
## Academic Career
I obtained my Integrated Bachelors and Masters of Science in Mathematics  in 2017 from the [Department of Mathematics and Statistics](https://math.iiserkol.ac.in/), [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Kolkata](https://www.iiserkol.ac.in/web/en/#gsc.tab=0) with a [INSPIRE-SHE ](https://www.online-inspire.gov.in/Account/INSPIREProgramme) Scholarship. My masters thesis was supervised by [**Associate Professor Dr. Kuntal Ghosh**](https://www.isical.ac.in/kuntal-ghosh), [Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata](https://www.isical.ac.in/).

At that point in my career I wanted to do something more applied, hence I joined a Erusmus Mundus, Engineering Mathematics Masters program called [Mathmods](https://www.mathmods.eu/), jointly organised by [University of L'aquila](https://www.disim.univaq.it/), Italy and  [University of Hamburg](https://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/en.html), Germany. My masters thesis was supervised by [**Professor Dr. Nicola Guglielmi**](https://www.gssi.it/people/professors/lectures-maths/item/545-guglielmi-nicola) from the [Gran sasso Research Institute](https://www.gssi.it/), L'aquila. I graduated my second masters in December 2020. Due to the pandemic and other personal reasons I took a break from my career for about a year or so.

 I joined [Institute of Scientific Computing](https://tu-dresden.de/mn/math/wir/das-institut?set_language=en), [TU Dresden](https://tu-dresden.de/?set_language=en) in September 2022 to work with [Jun. Prof. Dr. Markus Schmidtchen](https://www.markusschmidtchen.com/about.html) on *'Systems of Interacting Species'*.
